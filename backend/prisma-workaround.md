# Prisma Client Generation Issue

## Problem
Unable to generate Prisma Client due to network restrictions (403 Forbidden from binaries.prisma.sh CDN).

## Attempted Solutions
1. PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING=1 - Failed
2. Using GitHub mirror - Failed  
3. NO_PROXY settings - Failed (DNS resolution issues)
4. Direct curl/wget download - Failed (404/403 errors)

## Root Cause
The environment's proxy (21.0.0.191:15002) is blocking access to Prisma's CDN.

## Alternative Approaches
1. Use better-sqlite3 with raw SQL queries (no ORM)
2. Use a different ORM that doesn't require binary downloads
3. Pre-download engines in a different environment and commit them
4. Request proxy whitelist for binaries.prisma.sh

## Recommendation
For now, create a simplified backend using better-sqlite3 directly, then migrate to Prisma once network access is resolved.
