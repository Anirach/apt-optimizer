## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Prisma Migration Fails
```bash
# Solution: Reset database
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run prisma:seed
```

### Issue 2: Tests Fail with Database Locks
```bash
# Solution: Close all connections before tests
# See src/__tests__/setup.ts beforeEach hook
```

### Issue 3: CORS Errors
```typescript
// Solution: Check backend cors config
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:8080',
  credentials: true
}));
```

### Issue 4: JWT Token Invalid
```bash
# Solution: Check JWT_SECRET in .env matches between requests
# Ensure token is sent with "Bearer " prefix
```
